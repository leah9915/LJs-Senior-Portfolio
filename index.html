            <h1>Hi, I'm Leah Jarvis!</h1>
            <h4>You can call me LJ!</h4>
            <p> I am currently a 17-year-old senior in the Web & App Development program at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. Along with web design, I also enjoy reading, fashion, journaling, art, and graphic design. 
		After graduating from TAEHS, I plan to study Fashion Business Management at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Chelsea, NY.

		Enough about me! This portfolio is a compilation of all the labs and projects I've worked on in the Web and App Development course at Edison. Enjoy! </p>
